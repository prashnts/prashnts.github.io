  I am a software developer based in Paris. My work focuses on using programming,
  mathematics, and design as tools to solve interesting and challenging problems.
  My projects span a wide array of domains: Computer Vision, Machine Learning,
  Data Visualisation, Web Applications, and Embedded systems.

      # Hydrodynamics of Super-Paramagnetic Micro-Beads

      My work here was to capture the motion of the micro beads undergoing
      attraction due to an external magnetic field. Based on this it is possible
      to quantify hydrodynamic drag forces on the beads.

      Using open source tools `trackpy` and `scikit-image`, I developed an
      image processing pipeline to isolate, track, and calculate motion dynamics
      from the frames. We reached an average frame rate of `~800 fps`.

      # The Mechanical Sense of Paramecium

      As a research intern, I developed high-frequency, real-time image analysis
      and hardware control pipeline to track long trajectories of _Paramecium_.
      I wrote a driver for the microscope stage, and a high-speed image
      aquisition and processing (~50fps) tool. Using these software we were able
      to follow the trajectory of moving _Paramecium_.

      # Study of Diversity in Phyllotactic Patterns

      Phyllotaxis is the arrangement of lateral organs in plants. In this
      project we attempt to explain the origin of emergent patterns,
      transitions, and irregularities in such arrangements. Using cylindrical
      projection unrolling and unwarping, I developed an image analysis pipeline
      allowing better study of complicated plant organs.

      # Computer Vision and Information Extraction

      Developed and shipped a utility for digitizing waveforms and
      extracting metadata from `ECG` reports. It is being used at Brigham and
      Women’s Hospital, Boston for processing more than a million patient records.

      Also worked on extracting normalized tabular data from scanned
      medical records. Key challenges here involved handling skewed,
      desaturated and otherwise low quality images.

      # Human Activity Recognition from Acceleration data Under Naturalistic Conditions

      The goal of this project was to develop a system for recognition
      of low level human activities, such as Walking, Running, Sitting, etc.,
      using a single accelerometer.

      Using supervised learning method, we trained a Random Forest
      Classifier using feature vectors obtained via our model. We
      were able to produce an accuracy of `95%` through our model.

      # Modelling and Network Analysis of Intronic miRNA Mediated Gene Expression Regulation

      In this project, we developed a mathematical model for gene expression
      regulation via intronic micro `RNAs`, based on emperical data and
      experimental observations at IGIB.

      As a part of study, we've also generated a `miRNA <=> mRNA` target network
      using various available databases.
